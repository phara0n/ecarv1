# eCar Garage Management Application - Security Guidelines

This document outlines security practices and guidelines for the eCar Garage Management Application.

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication

- The application uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- Passwords are hashed using BCrypt with appropriate work factor
- Passwords must contain at least 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, and special characters
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts

### Authorization

- Role-based access control (RBAC) with the following roles:
  - Admin: Full access to all features
  - Manager: Access to customer and vehicle data, limited administrative capabilities
  - Technician: Access to assigned repairs only
  - Customer: Access to own vehicles and repair history only
- Each API endpoint has appropriate authorization checks

## API Security

### Endpoint Security

- All API endpoints require authentication except public endpoints (login, registration)
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent brute force attacks
- CORS is properly configured to allow only trusted origins
- Sensitive operations require re-authentication

### Input Validation

- All user inputs are validated on both client and server sides
- Parameterized queries are used to prevent SQL injection
- Content Security Policy (CSP) is implemented to prevent XSS attacks

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

- Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is encrypted at rest
- Credit card information is never stored; payment processing is handled by a third-party provider
- Data minimization practices are followed - only necessary information is collected

### Data in Transit

- All communications use HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
- Secure cookies with HttpOnly and Secure flags
- HSTS is enabled to prevent downgrade attacks

## Infrastructure Security

### Server Hardening

- Security updates are applied regularly
- Unused services and ports are disabled
- Firewall is configured to allow only necessary traffic
- Non-root users are used for running application services

### Database Security

- Database is not directly accessible from the public internet
- Regular backups with encryption
- Database credentials are stored securely, not in code repositories
- Strong passwords are enforced for database users

## Deployment Security

### Secrets Management

- Environment variables are used for secrets
- `.env` files are excluded from version control
- Different secrets are used for each environment (development, staging, production)

### Docker Security

- Latest security patches are applied to base images
- Non-root users are used in containers
- Container resources are limited appropriately
- Network segmentation between containers

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Logging and Monitoring

- Security-related events are logged with appropriate detail
- Logs are stored securely and can't be modified
- Unusual activity triggers alerts
- Regular log reviews are conducted

### Incident Response

- Security incident response plan is documented and tested
- Contact information for security team is readily available
- Procedures for reporting security vulnerabilities are established

## Compliance

- Application follows GDPR requirements for European users
- Privacy policy is clearly communicated to users
- Data retention policies are implemented and enforced
- Users can request deletion of their data

## Security Testing

- Regular security testing is performed, including:
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
  - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
  - Dependency scanning for vulnerabilities
  - Regular penetration testing

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by sending an email to security@ecar.tn. Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed by our team.

## Security Updates
