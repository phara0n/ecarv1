# Test Implementation for eCar Garage Admin Interface

This document outlines the test implementation for the eCar Garage Admin Interface application. The testing setup includes unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests to ensure the application functions correctly and reliably.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized in the following directory structure:

```
test/
├── models/              # Tests for data models
│   ├── customer_test.dart
│   ├── repair_test.dart
│   └── vehicle_test.dart
├── services/            # Tests for API services
│   ├── customer_service_test.dart
│   ├── repair_service_test.dart
│   └── vehicle_service_test.dart
├── widgets/             # Tests for UI components
│   ├── statistic_card_test.dart
│   └── data_table_test.dart
└── widget_test.dart     # Application-level widget tests
```

## Test Types

### 1. Model Tests

These tests verify that data models correctly handle JSON serialization/deserialization, utility methods, and status helpers:

- **Vehicle Model Tests**: Tests brand handling, service status calculation, and date formatting
- **Customer Model Tests**: Tests active status handling, avatar generation, and formatting methods
- **Repair Model Tests**: Tests status handling (scheduled, in progress, completed, cancelled) and payment status

### 2. Service Tests

These tests verify the API services interact correctly with the backend:

- **VehicleService Tests**: Tests CRUD operations, statistics retrieval, and specialized methods like mileage updates
- **CustomerService Tests**: Tests customer management, statistics retrieval, and relationship queries
- **RepairService Tests**: Tests repair management, status updates, and payment handling

Each service test uses `mocktail` to mock HTTP requests and simulate server responses, ensuring tests are isolated from actual network calls.

### 3. Widget Tests

These tests verify UI components render correctly and respond to user interactions:

- **StatisticCard Tests**: Tests rendering, styling, loading states, and tap functionality
- **CustomDataTable Tests**: Tests data display, pagination, sorting, filtering, and loading states

### 4. Integration Tests

Basic integration tests ensure the application renders properly and navigates between screens correctly.

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
flutter test test/models/vehicle_test.dart
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

## Test Dependencies

The test implementation uses the following packages:

- `flutter_test`: Flutter's testing framework
- `mocktail`: For mocking dependencies in tests
- `http`: For testing API requests

## Future Test Improvements

1. Increase test coverage for all components
2. Add more detailed integration tests
3. Implement golden tests for visual regression testing
4. Set up continuous integration for automated testing

## Test Maintenance Guidelines

1. Always update tests when modifying models, services, or widgets
2. Keep mock data in sync with actual API responses
3. Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on external state
4. Document edge cases and special test scenarios
