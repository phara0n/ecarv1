# eCar Garage Application Testing Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the eCar Garage Management Application, covering both the mobile customer application and the web admin interface.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

#### Backend (Rails)
- **Models**: Test validations, associations, scopes, and custom methods
- **Controllers**: Test API endpoints, request/response handling, authentication checks

### 2. Integration Testing

- **API Integration**: Test complete request/response cycles across multiple endpoints
- **Authentication Flow**: Test complete login, logout, and token refresh flows
- **Multi-step Processes**: Test repair creation, updates, and invoicing as complete workflows
- **Email Delivery**: Test complete email generation and delivery pipeline

### 3. End-to-End Testing

- **Customer Journeys**: Complete flows from registration to vehicle management to repair tracking
- **Admin Workflows**: Complete flows for customer management, repair assignment, and invoicing
- **Cross-device Testing**: Verify application works across mobile and web interfaces

## Test Case Structure

Each test case should follow this structure:

```
# Test ID: [AREA]-[NUMBER]
## Test Name: [Brief descriptor]
## Objective: [What is being tested]
## Prerequisites: [Required setup]
## Test Steps:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...
## Expected Results:
- [Expected outcome 1]
- [Expected outcome 2]
...
## Actual Results:
- [Actual outcome observed during testing]
## Status: [Pass/Fail/Blocked]
## Notes: [Any additional information]
```

## Testing Schedule

1. **Unit Tests**: Continuous with each feature implementation
2. **Integration Tests**: Weekly on feature completion
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Bi-weekly on staging environment
4. **Regression Tests**: Before each release
5. **Performance Tests**: Monthly
6. **Security Tests**: Quarterly

## Reporting
